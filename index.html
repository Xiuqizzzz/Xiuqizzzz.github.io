      <h1>Tommy Zhu</h1>
      <h2>Ph.D. Student @ Northeastern University</h2>

      <p class="bio">
        Hello! <br><br>
        My name is Tommy Zhu<br><br>

        I am a Second-Year Ph.D. student at Northeastern_CAMD., advised by Prof. Eileen McGivney. My research interest lies in the interdisciplinary area of Human-Computer Interaction, with the intersection of Multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs), Extended Reality, and Education Computing. My research focuses on integrating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) into XR to:<br>
        1. Seamlessly interpret, understand, and respond to users’ environments and needs in real-time, enabling XR to support complex, collaborative, and everyday multi-user tasks.<br>
        2. Transform interactive educational content into dynamic, personalized, and memorable simulation-based learning experiences through AI-driven, adaptive instruction.<br><br>

        I have been honored to do research with various amazing advisors, such as the Future Lab (Prof. YangJiao & Prof. Yingqing Xu), CAS Key Laboratory of Behavioral Science (Prof. Jingyu Zhang), and the LDC Lab (Prof. Min Fan). I have also interned at Lark Suite-People as a UX researcher. I received my bachelor's degree of Digital Media Arts from the Communication University of China. My works have won numerous awards in art and design competitions and had been exhibited in multiple art galleries.
